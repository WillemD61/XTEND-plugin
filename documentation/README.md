These files contain the results of the code analysis of the XTEND screens using Wireshark. <br/> <br/>
The XTEND screens perform a HTTP-GET to get and display data values on the screen. 
The HTTP-GET statement can be seen with Wireshark and the statement can then be executed with a browser or with the curl command on a command line to get the same values.
This can be used to try and match the codes to the fields shown on the screens.
<br/><br/>
The three JPG files show the XTEND screens with current results of the analysis (work in progress)
<br/><br/>
The Excel file shows the cross reference to info from the Home-Assistant integration used for the development of the first version of this Domoticz plugin and to the devices used in the plugin itself.
